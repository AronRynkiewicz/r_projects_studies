# Overview
Analysis projects made in R for studies projects:
- biomedical statistics - basic analysis of biomedical data.
- PCA - futher analysis of the same data, but using Principal Component Analysis

# Data
[Data](https://github.com/AronRynkiewicz/r_projects_studies/blob/master/data/przykladoweDane-Projekt.csv) used for analysis comes from blood test. Following parameters were measured:
* hsCRP - an annular (ring-shaped) protein found in blood plasma, whose circulating concentrations rise in response to inflammation.
* ERY - most common type of blood cell and the vertebrate's principal means of delivering oxygen.
* PLT - a component of blood whose function is to react to bleeding from blood vessel injury by clumping.
* HGB - the iron-containing oxygen-transport metalloprotein in the red blood cells.
* HCT - the volume percentage of red blood cells in blood.
* MCHC - a measure of the concentration of haemoglobin in a given volume of packed red blood cell.
* MON - the largest type of leukocyte and can differentiate into macrophages and conventional dendritic cells.
* LEU - the cells of the immune system that are involved in protecting the body against both infectious disease and foreign invaders.

# Description
There are two reports in Polish:
* [biomedical statistics](https://github.com/AronRynkiewicz/r_projects_studies/blob/master/biomedical_statistics/lab1.pdf)
* [PCA](https://github.com/AronRynkiewicz/r_projects_studies/blob/master/PCA/lab2.pdf)

which describes in details steps of analysis and obtained results. In short, first analysis (biomedical statistics) was performed to obtain basic information about given dataset through:
* descriptive statistics
* benchmarking
* correlation analysis

The goal of second analysis (PCA) was to confirm or disprove conclusions made in first one through using diffrent analysis method.
